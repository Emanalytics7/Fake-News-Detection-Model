Fake News Classification MLOps Project
Introduction
This repository hosts an end-to-end MLOps project that demonstrates the lifecycle of a Machine Learning (ML) project aimed at classifying news as fake or real. This guide will walk you through the MLOps cycle stages, as implemented in this project.

The MLOps Cycle
1. Data Management
Ingestion:

src/pipeline/stage_01_ingestion.py: Script to ingest data from sources.
Storage:

data/: Directory to store raw data, intermediate datasets, and final processed data.
2. Experimentation and Development
Notebooks:

notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for data exploration and initial experimentation.
Code Development:

src/: Source code that includes scripts for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. Continuous Integration and Testing
Testing:

tests/: Contains automated tests for data ingestion, preprocessing, and API endpoints.
Integration:

.github/workflows/: CI/CD configuration files (if you set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment).
4. Model Training and Evaluation
Training and Evaluation Pipeline:

src/pipeline/stage_02_preprocessing.py: Preprocessing script.
src/pipeline/stage_03_training.py: Model training script.
src/pipeline/stage_04_evaluation.py: Model evaluation script.
5. Model Deployment
API:

api/app.py: Flask API that serves model predictions.
Docker:

Dockerfile: Defines the environment to containerize the API for deployment.
6. Monitoring and Operations
Explain how monitoring would work in a production environment (this could be hypothetical if you haven't implemented monitoring).

Installation and Usage
Prerequisites
